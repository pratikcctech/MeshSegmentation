# 3D Surface Visualizer

This is a 3D surface visualizer application that allows you to load STL files, visualize the triangular mesh, and perform surface detection algorithms such as planar and cylindrical surface detection.

## Features
- Browse and load STL files.
- Render and visualize the triangular mesh from the loaded STL file.
- Perform planar surface detection on the loaded mesh.
- Perform cylindrical surface detection on the loaded mesh.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred C++ development environment.
3. Build and run the application.

## Usage
1. Click on the "Browse STL" button to select an STL file.
2. After loading the file, click on the "render STL" button to visualize the triangular mesh.
3. Perform planar surface detection by clicking on the "planar Surface" button.
4. Perform cylindrical surface detection by clicking on the "Cylindrical Surface" button.

## Dependencies
- This application uses the Qt framework for the graphical user interface.
- OpenGL is used for rendering the 3D mesh.
